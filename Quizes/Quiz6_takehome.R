#For my app I chose to use the happy planet data set to look at the graph of 3 variables:
#HPI Rank, (the rank of the countryâ€™s Happy Planet Index)
#Life Expectancy (the average life expectancy of a citizen), 
#Happy Life Years (a combination of life expectancy and wellbeing), and sort them by region.
# The purpose of this app was to select a variable and compare the distributions by each region.
# In order to more successfully compare, I set all graphs to the same window size
# so that you can see the differences from region to region.
