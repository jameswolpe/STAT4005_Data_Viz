```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
alcohol_df <- read_csv(here("data/alcohol.csv"))
```
## Question 2

```{r}
world_df <- map_data("world")

world_fullB <- left_join(world_df, alcohol_df, by = c("region" = "country"))

ggplot(data = world_fullB,
            mapping = aes(x = long, y = lat,
                          group = group)) +
  geom_polygon(colour = "black", aes(fill = beer_servings)) +
  coord_map(projection = "mercator", xlim=c(-180,180)) +
  scale_fill_viridis_b(option = "plasma")
```

## Question 1 
A time where you would not want to use a map visualization is if you were trying to see a trend of total alcohol consumption by region of the world in which case you would want to use a scatter plot and possibly group world region by country, this way you could see the trend over time
