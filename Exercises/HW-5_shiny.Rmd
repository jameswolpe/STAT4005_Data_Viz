#Exercise 1 
The first app allows the user to modify 4 variables of a random data generator: the number of data points in the sample, the intercept of the best fit line, the slope of the best fit line, and the standard deviation of residuals. 

#Exercise 2
The outputs of the app are both graphs of the best fit line and variation in the model, as well as tables of summary statistics for both.

#Exercise 3
I selected an app that visualizes covid-19 data on a map. Thee are many things the user can change, to view specific regions and statistics of interest. The app allows you to view how many covid cases there were at a given time (both new and cumulative), as well as play an animation from that selected date to see where and how case numbers changed. One interresting thing I found was comparing covid-19 to other virus outbreaks such as H1N1, Ebola and SARS.
