## 3.2

1. Humans naturally make infrences based on relationships we see. In the 
Anscombeâ€™s quartet example it is visualy clear that these 3 scatter plots show someting entirely different but a look at the summary data would show otherwise.

2. This chart is in "bad taste" because it has a lot of needles information on it: The continents are labeled on the key and the chart itself, the title is poor and confusing, the continents are ordered by alphabetical rather than least to most life expectancy.


3. One should avoid "content-free decoration" if charts lke the bar plot above were more simple and cleaned up (used less ink) they would be easier to read and make inferences from.

4. The authors mean that you cant make these relative baselines on a plot like a stacked bar chart. In the example of 1.11 it is very hard to compare the green b values as they all begin at a different point.

5. My main key take away is that more is not better and is often worse in data visualization, I am sure this if a problem I will run into as I am able to do more with data visualization. Another key takeaway is the use if color or lack there of, there is a husge amount of power in the humans eye to discern shades of black and white.

6. No real questions I just hope we continue to talk about some of these examples as the chapter was meaty.
